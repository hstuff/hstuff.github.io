<p> Howdy! </p>

<p> I am a PhD student in mathematics at The University of Pennsylvania, and was formerly an undergraduate at The University of Texas at Austin. My main interests lie in geometric analysis and partial differential equations--especially geometric measure theory, curvature flow, and minimal surfaces. <p>

<h2> Notes and Expository Writing</h2>

<p> Collected below are a potpourri of expositional pieces and notes I've written up. Some are Tex'd, most are handwritten, and I hope they might be of some help. If you happen to come across any typos or errors, please let me know. </p>

<h5 style="font-size:1.17em;"> Music and Other Odds and Ends </h5>
<p> On occasion I do stuff other than math! In particular I love to play the bass trombone and bass guitar, and am generally very excited about music. Finding seldom heard composers and their works is a favorite hobby of mine, and I have a running list going here (WARNING: it's very disorganized and definitely biased towards the low brass). I'd be super excited to chat about such things, and am always looking out for listening suggestions. </p>

<p> Airplanes are cool, and I recently got to meet one of my favorites at the Seattle Museum of Flight (a replica Granville Gee Bee model Z): <p> <img src="images/homepagepic3.jpg"  height="300" >  </p>
