<p> Howdy! </p>

<p> I am a PhD student in mathematics at The University of Pennsylvania, and was formerly an undergraduate at The University of Texas at Austin. My main interests lie in geometric analysis and partial differential equations--especially concerning spaces of low-regularity, geometric measure theory, and lower curvature bounds. My recent work has largely concerned almost-rigidity problems and the structure of limit spaces.

<h2> Notes and Expository Writing </h2>

<p> Collected below are a small potpourri of expositional pieces and notes I've written up. I hope they might be of some help, and I may upload more later. If you happen to come across any typos or errors, please let me know. </p>

<ol>
    <li> <a href="/Users/hstufflebeam/Desktop/Mathematics/webpage/Associated Docs/Allard's_epsilon_thm copy.pdf">Allard Type Regularity Theorems for Rectifiable Varifolds</a>. My undergraduate thesis at UT Austin, under the supervision of Francesco Maggi and Salvatore Stuvard (2019). This could probably also serve as an introduction to the regulartity theory of rectifiable varifolds.</li>
    <li> <a href="/Users/hstufflebeam/Desktop/Mathematics/webpage/Associated Docs/The Yamabe Problem.pdf">The Yamabe Problem</a>. A set of notes I wrote for a series of talks at UPenn, based on the (wonderful) paper by Lee and Parker, and the (wonderful) set of notes by Robin Neumayer.</li>

<h2> Resources and Links </h2>

I'll keep updating this as I get the time...

<h3>Mathematical Resources:</h3>

<li> Although we might not think about it as much as we should, as mathematicians we have an enormous responsibility when it comes to not just how we disseminate knowledge and act as educators, but also with how our work is used. <a href="https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's</a> a link to the Just Mathematics Collective, an organziation committed to ethical mathematics. </li>

<li> <a href="https://www.math.purdue.edu/~adebray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's</a> a link to my friend Arun Debray's academic webpage, which, in particular, has many amazing notes and resources. </li>

<li> <a href="https://researchseminars.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's</a> a link to a running calendar of online math seminars. </li>

<li> Can't remember how to typeset something in latex? <a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's</a> a link for that if you remember how to draw what you want. </li>

<li> <a href="https://tikzit.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's</a> a great resource for generating tikz diagrams. </li>

<li> A good education in Riemannian geometry is no substitute for knowing of the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_formulas_in_Riemannian_geometry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a> eternally useful wiki page (a list of common formulas and identities in Riemannian geometry). </li>




<h3>Useful Resources for UPenn students:</h3>


<li> <a href="https://universitylife.upenn.edu/support-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's</a> a link to support resources available to UPenn students. </li>

<li> <a href="https://gsc.upenn.edu/resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's</a> a link to resources akin to the above, but directed more specifically towards graduate students. </li>

<li> If you somehow found this page, but cannot locate the UPenn math website, <a href="https://www.math.upenn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> here's</a> a link to that. </li>

<li> Is SEPTA ok? Does this train even exist? Why does apple maps say my bus is in northern Africa? <a href="https://www.isseptafucked.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Click here</a> if you're fine with liberal use of profanity to find out if something's afoot. </li>





<h3>Fun Links:</h3>

<li> <a href="https://a.carapetis.com/csf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's</a> an applet that allows you to draw a closed plane curve and watch its evolution under the curve shortening flow. </li>

<li> <a href="https://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/91953/Doxiadis_-_Uncle_Petros_and_Goldbach.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's</a> a book called ``Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture'' about why you should study geometric analysis and not number theory ;) </li>

<li> <a href="https://imkevinkuo.github.io/rhythm.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's</a> an applet that **roughly** notates a rhythm you tap out. </li>

<h2>Other Odds and Ends </h2>
<p> I do stuff other than math!

In particular I play the bass trombone and electric bass, and am generally very excited about music. <br> You can hear me play trombone in the Penn Symphony Orchestra (<a href="https://music.sas.upenn.edu/ensembles/penn-symphony-orchestra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link</a>) at one of our four yearly concerts which are free to attend! We have recently played Mahler Symphonies 1 and 2, Rachmanninov's Symphony 2 and Symphonic Dances, Tchaikovsky's Symphony 5, Sibelius' Symphony 2, Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade, Mussorgsy-Ravel's Pictures at an Exhibition, and soooo much more.

<br> If you hear me playing bass you've wandered into a west philly punk jam situation and should consider taking evasive action.
    



<!--Finding seldom heard composers and their works is a favorite hobby of mine, and I have a running list going here (WARNING: it's very disorganized and definitely biased towards the low brass). FYI I'm always looking out for more listening suggestions. --></p>
